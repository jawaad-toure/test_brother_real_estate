## About Tests

None test have been perform


## Issues faced

Sort functionnality does not work has I want. But it sorting were the main difficulties I faced. 

However, I managed to put something together. 

To get the desired result for a sort, you have to click on the button to make it “active” and to cancel the sort, you have to click on the button again.

Clicking on an X button and then on a Y button will work, but not correctly.

## About time to complete the test

As I'm currently on a internship, I haven't had enough time to work as I should or to go further in the tasks to be carried out. 

For example, I had to repeat some code just to complete the sorting part. I hope I won't be penalised for that.

## Technologies

As far as technology is concerned, I've used scss and bootstrap in addition to the existing ones. 

Scss to avoid repeating code when writing styles and bootstrap to avoid having to write scss as a priority. 

So I use bootstrap as a priority and when I don't get the result I'm looking for I use scss.
